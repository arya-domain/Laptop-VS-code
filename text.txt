The most complication arises mainly during data preprocessing and identifying the features from a raw dataset. 
During the processing of an RNA sequencing dataset that I made from scratch, I faced a difficulty of selection of features.
As the dataset was composed of nurmic gene counts which was normalised with FPKM. 
Thus which genes actually matters for the accuracy detection was difficult to select as there were total of 62.7K gene ids 
present in single sample of the dataset.
